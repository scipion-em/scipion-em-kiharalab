Kihara Lab plugin
========================================
This is a **Scipion** plugin that offers different `Kihara Lab tools <https://kiharalab.org/>`_.
These tools will make it possible to carry out different functions for working with electron density maps.
The code involving these functionalities can be found at https://github.com/kiharalab.

Therefore, this plugin allows to use programs from the DAQ software suite
within the Scipion framework.

========================================
Install this plugin
========================================
You will need to use `Scipion3 <https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/docs/scipion
-modes/how-to-install.html>`_ to run these protocols.

DAQ, Emap2sec, Emap2sec+, and MainMast are installed automatically by scipion.

**Note:** Emap2sec+ needs an Nvidia GPU to run.
